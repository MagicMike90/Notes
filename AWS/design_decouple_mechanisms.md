# design decouple mechanisms

## Foundation

**Decoupling**: components remaining potentially autonomous and unaware of each other as they complete their work for some greater output. This decoupling can be used to describe components that make up a simple application, and the term even applies on a broad scale

- _Image Decoupling Demystified_: What exactly does it mean to design decoupling mechanisms in AWS? This section makes sense of this concept for you if you’re not familiar with it.

- _Image Advantages of Decoupled Designs_: What advantages can you gain if you design decoupled services and resources? This section provides many of the possible advantages.

- _Image Synchronous Decoupling_: One type of decoupling is called synchronous decoupling. This section details this approach.

- _Image Asynchronous Decoupling_: Another type of decoupling is termed asynchronous. This section examines decoupling in detail, and you learn how to configure the AWS SQS service, which is often a key element in the desired “loose” coupling architectural approach.
