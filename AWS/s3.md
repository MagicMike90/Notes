   - Many of the S3 standard features, such as incredible durability
   - Designed for less frequent access but still provides responsiveness
   - An ideal class for workloads like backups
   - Designed for 99.9 percent availability

3. One Zone-Infrequent Access

   - This might be an ideal class for objects like secondary backup copies of data.
   - The objects in this storage class could be replicated to another region should the need arise to increase the availability.
   - As you would guess, availability here is reduced slightly and is designed for 99.5 percent.
   - There is a risk of data loss in the event of an AZâ€™s destruction.
