# Dimensionality Reduction

## Principal component analysis (PCA)

It is an unsupervised linear transformation technique that is widely used across different fields, most prominently for dimensionality reduction.

## Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)

It can be used as a technique for feature extraction to increase the computational efficientcy and reduce the degreee of over-fitting due to the curse of dimensionality in nonregularized models.

## Kernel principal component analysis

It will transform data that is not linearly separable onto a new, lower-dimensional subspace that is suitable for linear classifiers

Downside: This approach is computational expesnsive, but it can be overcome by kernel trick.

**Radial Basis Function (RBF)**
