# Introduction

Machine learning summarized in four categories.
- Predictive learning: comprises two kinds of tasks where we aim to either predict a continuous valued phenomenon (like the future location of a celestial body), or distinguish between distinct kings of things (like different faces in an image)
- Feature design: A broad set of engineering and mathematical tools which are crucial to the successful performance of predictive learning models in practice.
- Function approximation: It is employed when we know too little abut a dataset to produce proper features ourselves (and therefore must learn them strictly from the data itself).
- Numerical optimization  powers the first three and is the engine that makes machine learning run in practice.

## Basic process
1. Define task
2. Collect data
3. Design features
4. Train model
5. Test model

## Predictive learning problems
1. Regression: 
2. Classification: The key difference between the two is that instead of predicting a continuous-valued output (e.g., share price blood pressure, etc.), with classification what we aim at predicting takes on discrete values or classes.
