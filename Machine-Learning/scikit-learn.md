# Scifit-learn

**Overfitting** means that the model captures the patterns in the training data well, but fails to generalize well to unseen data.

- Training data: the slited data used to build machine learning model
- Test data: the reset of the data is used to assess how well the model words
- In scikit-learn, data is usually denoted with a capital X, while labels are denoted by a lowercase y. This is inspired by the standard formulation f(x) = y in mathematics, where x is the input to a function and y is the output.
- X (capital) represents two-dimensional array ( a matrix) and a lowercase y represents one-dimensioanl array (a vector)
