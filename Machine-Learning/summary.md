# Summary of machine learning

## Common used machine learning algorithm

Listed in order of increasing complexity:

- Logiistic regressiong
- K-nearest neighbors - Number of nearest neighbors to average
- Decision trees - Splitting criterion, max depth or tree, minimum saples needed to make a split
- Kernel SVM - Kernel type, kernel coefficient, penalty parameter
- Random forest - Number of trees, number of features to split in each node, splitting criterion, minimum saples needed to make a split
- Boosting - Number of trees learning rate, max depth of tree, split in each node, splitting criterion, minimun samples needed to make a split

## General procesdure

- Data processing
- Dimensionality reduction
- Split train and test data set
- Train data
- Model evaluation and hyperparameter tuning
- Save model
