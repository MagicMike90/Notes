# SOA VS Mircoservice

Microservices are fine-grained SOA components. In other words, a single SOA
component can be decomposed in a number of microservices that can work together
in order to provide the same level of functionality

J2EE is a technology stack that was designed to write SOA architectures as it
enforced enterprise standards. Java Naming and Directory Interface, Enterprise
Java Beans, and Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) were the ecosystems where SOA
applications were built and maintained. Although ESB is a standard, very few
engineers who graduated after 2005 have heard about ESB, even fewer have used it,
and nowadays the modern frameworks such as Ruby on Rails do not even consider
such complex pieces of software.
