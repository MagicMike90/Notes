# Notes for Progressive Web App

## Case study 1 - Facebook

Facebook tried to make the web its primary platform, but due to many engineering mistakes and browser/hardware limitations, they failed. At that point, they switched to native apps as a primary focus and have since created a very large, walled off community of data and interactions.

## Case study 2 - Flipkart (he Amazon of the Indian sub-continent)

Flipkart's consumer market consists of customers almost entirely on poor mobile connections. Their mobile devices have limited storage and may or may not have a reliable 3G connection. In fact, 63% reach the site via 2G. A client application experience that loads quickly and works even when the network is absent gives Flipkart a business advantage.
